# Investment Recommendations for American Equity Investors
## European Equity Markets Analysis (2021-2025)

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides actionable investment recommendations for **American equity investors** considering European equity markets. Based on comprehensive CAPM analysis of 245 stocks across 7 European markets, we identify key opportunities and risks.

**Key Finding:** CAPM is **rejected** in European markets - beta does not explain expected returns. This creates opportunities for factor-based and active strategies.

**Primary Recommendation:** Hybrid approach combining passive core (60-70%) with factor tilts (20-30%) and selective active management (10-20%).

## 1. Currency Risk Analysis

### Current Exposure

**MSCI Indexes are USD-Denominated:**
- All MSCI country indexes used in this analysis are **USD-denominated iShares ETFs**
- Tickers: EWG (Germany), EWQ (France), EWI (Italy), EWP (Spain), EWD (Sweden), EWU (UK), EWL (Switzerland)
- **Implication:** For USD-based investors, currency risk is already incorporated in ETF returns
- **No additional currency conversion needed** when using these ETFs

### Currency Breakdown

- **EUR**: 4 country(ies) - Germany, France, Italy, Spain
  - Exposure: USD/EUR exchange rate risk
  - Hedging complexity: Medium (EUR futures/options available)

- **GBP**: 1 country(ies) - United Kingdom
  - Exposure: USD/GBP exchange rate risk
  - Hedging complexity: Low (GBP futures/options liquid)

- **CHF**: 1 country(ies) - Switzerland
  - Exposure: USD/CHF exchange rate risk
  - Hedging complexity: Medium (CHF futures available)

- **SEK**: 1 country(ies) - Sweden
  - Exposure: USD/SEK exchange rate risk
  - Hedging complexity: High (SEK futures less liquid)


### Hedging Recommendations

**Recommended Strategy: No Hedging (Use USD-Denominated ETFs)**

**Rationale:**
- MSCI country ETFs are already USD-denominated
- Currency risk is incorporated in ETF returns
- Simplifies portfolio management
- Reduces hedging costs (0.1-0.3% annually)

**Implementation:**
- Use iShares country ETFs directly: EWG, EWQ, EWI, EWP, EWD, EWU, EWL
- All ETFs trade in USD on US exchanges
- No currency conversion needed

**Alternative: Selective Hedging (If Holding Individual Stocks)**
- Hedge EUR/GBP exposure if portfolio weight >20% in single currency
- Use currency futures or options for major currencies
- Cost: 0.1-0.3% annually (futures basis risk)

| Switzerland | 16 | 0.832 | 0.32% | 0.246 | 93.8% |

### Allocation Recommendations

**Given Negative Beta-Return Relationship:**
- Lower-beta countries may offer better risk-adjusted returns
- Equal-weight allocation recommended for diversification

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **Equal-weight across all 7 countries:** ~14.3% per country
- **Rationale:** Maximizes diversification benefits (82.0% variance reduction if available)
- **Implementation:** Use equal-weight country ETFs or manually rebalance

**Country-Specific Notes:**
- **Overweight:** Spain, Italy (lower beta, potentially better risk-adjusted returns)
- **Underweight:** Sweden (higher beta, potentially lower risk-adjusted returns)

## 3. Factor-Based Investment Strategy

### Key Findings

**Low-Beta Strategy:**
- Low-beta portfolio return: 1.20% (monthly)
- High-beta portfolio return: 0.54% (monthly)
- Spread: 0.66% (monthly)
- **Recommendation:** Overweight low-beta stocks

**Value Strategy:**

### Factor Allocation Recommendations

**Recommended Factor Mix:**

**Value (15-25%):**
- Rationale: Value effects may exist (or reverse), factor-based approach can add alpha
- Implementation: Focus on high book-to-market stocks or value ETFs

**Quality (20-30%):**
- Rationale: High-quality stocks may offer better risk-adjusted returns
- Implementation: Select stocks with high ROE, low debt, stable earnings

**Market (Core) (30-40%):**
- Rationale: Core market exposure provides diversification
