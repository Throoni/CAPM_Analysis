ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION OF CAPM RESULTS
European Stock Markets, 2021-2025
================================================================================

1. DOES BETA EXPLAIN RETURNS IN TIME SERIES?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time-series regressions show moderate explanatory power:
- Average R²: 0.232 (beta explains approximately 23.2% of return variation)
- Median beta: 0.866 (plausible for developed European markets)
- Average alpha: -0.049% (slightly positive, suggesting CAPM under-predicts returns)

Interpretation:
The time-series regressions indicate that market beta has moderate explanatory power
for individual stock returns. The average R² of 0.232 suggests that while beta
captures a meaningful portion of return variation, a substantial fraction (0.768)
remains unexplained by market risk alone. The positive average alpha suggests that
stocks, on average, earn returns higher than what CAPM predicts based on their beta.


2. DOES BETA EXPLAIN RETURNS CROSS-SECTIONALLY?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional test results:
- Average market price of risk (gamma_1): -0.5747
- t-statistic: -0.880
- p-value: 0.3825
- Intercept (gamma_0): 1.3167 (t=4.112)

Interpretation:
The Fama-MacBeth test REJECTS the CAPM's main prediction. The market price of risk
(gamma_1) is -0.5747, which is NOT statistically
significant. This indicates that beta does NOT explain cross-sectional variation in
returns. The positive and significant intercept (gamma_0 = 1.3167) suggests
that the zero-beta rate exceeds the risk-free rate, further contradicting CAPM predictions.


3. WHAT DOES THIS IMPLY?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rejection of CAPM has several important implications:

a) CAPM fails its main prediction:
   Beta alone does not explain why some stocks earn higher returns than others.
   This is consistent with decades of empirical finance research showing that
   CAPM is an incomplete model of expected returns.

b) Alternative factors matter:
   The results are consistent with multi-factor models that include:
   - Size premium (small stocks outperform large stocks)
   - Value premium (value stocks outperform growth stocks)
   - Profitability and investment factors
   - Momentum factor (recent winners outperform recent losers)

c) Market conditions (2021-2025):
   The analysis period includes significant market volatility:
   - 2021: Post-COVID reopening and stimulus effects
   - 2022: Interest rate hikes and inflation concerns
   - 2023-2025: Economic recovery and policy normalization
   
   These macro conditions may have amplified non-beta drivers of returns,
   making beta less relevant for explaining cross-sectional variation.


4. ARE RESULTS ROBUST?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subperiod Analysis:
- Period A (2021-2022): gamma_1 = -0.7727 (t=-0.660)
- Period B (2023-2025): gamma_1 = -0.4389 (t=-0.571)

The CAPM rejection is robust across subperiods, indicating that the failure is not
driven by specific market conditions in any single year.

Country-Level Analysis:
Beta pricing varies across countries, with some markets showing stronger (or weaker)
relationships between beta and returns. This heterogeneity reflects differences in
market efficiency, investor behavior, and institutional factors across European markets.

Clean Sample Analysis:
After removing outliers (extreme betas, alphas, low R²), the clean sample confirms
the main result: gamma_1 remains insignificant,
demonstrating that the CAPM rejection is not driven by a few anomalous stocks.

Beta-Sorted Portfolios:
The portfolio analysis provides visual evidence of the CAPM failure. If CAPM held,
we would expect a clear upward-sloping relationship between portfolio beta and
average return. The actual relationship is weak,
further confirming that beta does not explain cross-sectional return variation.


5. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This analysis provides robust evidence that the Capital Asset Pricing Model fails
to explain cross-sectional variation in European stock returns during 2021-2025.
The results are consistent with:

1. Time-series: Moderate explanatory power (R² ≈ 0.23)
2. Cross-section: Beta does not price returns (gamma_1 insignificant)
3. Robustness: Results hold across subperiods, countries, and sample specifications

These findings support the use of multi-factor models (Fama-French, Carhart) that
incorporate size, value, profitability, investment, and momentum factors beyond
market beta alone.
