## 1. Strategic Asset Allocation

### 1.1 Why Invest in European Equities?

| Benefit | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **Diversification** | Correlation with US equities < 1.0 |
| **Low-Beta Opportunity** | +13.5%/year alpha from low-beta stocks |
| **Currency Exposure** | EUR/GBP diversification from USD |
| **Valuation** | European markets trading at discount |

### 1.2 Recommended Allocation

For a US-based equity portfolio:

| Risk Profile | European Allocation | Strategy Focus |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 10-15% | Swiss, UK defensive stocks |
| Moderate | 15-20% | Diversified low-beta |
| Aggressive | 20-25% | Full European exposure |

---

## 2. Country Allocation

### 2.1 Analysis-Based Rankings

Based on our CAPM analysis:

| Rank | Country | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | **Switzerland** | Lowest beta (0.76), defensive characteristics |
| 2 | **United Kingdom** | Large market, diversified sectors, GBP exposure |
| 3 | **Germany** | Euro exposure, export-oriented economy |
| 4 | **France** | Core eurozone, luxury goods exposure |
| 5 | **Spain** | Higher growth potential |
| 6 | **Italy** | Selective opportunities |
| 7 | **Sweden** | Highest beta (1.02) - use selectively |

### 2.2 Recommended Country Weights

| Country | Weight | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Switzerland | 20% | Overweight for defensive |
| United Kingdom | 25% | Broad market exposure |
| Germany | 20% | Core eurozone |
| France | 15% | Diversification |
| Other EU | 20% | Spain, Italy, Sweden |

## 3. Factor-Based Strategy

### 3.1 Low-Beta Strategy

Our analysis demonstrates a significant low-beta anomaly:

**Strategy:** Overweight stocks with beta < 0.8

| Metric | Low-Beta Portfolio | Market |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Expected Alpha | +0.32%/month | 0% |
| Beta | 0.42 | 1.00 |
| Volatility | Lower | Baseline |

**Implementation:**
- Screen for European stocks with beta < 0.8
- Focus on utilities, healthcare, consumer staples
- Avoid high-beta technology and cyclicals

### 3.2 Quality Tilt

Combine low-beta with quality factors:
- Return on equity > 15%
- Debt/equity < 50%
- Consistent dividend growth

## 4. Portfolio Construction

### 4.1 Model Portfolio

Based on our mean-variance optimization:

| Component | Weight | Expected Return | Volatility |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|

| Min-Variance Portfolio | 20% | 0.87%/month | 1.56% |
| Cash (Risk-Free) | 10% | 0.13%/month | 0% |

**Combined Portfolio:**
- Expected Return: 1.72%/month (20.6% annualized)

- Sharpe Ratio: ~0.80

### 4.2 Risk Management

## 5. Currency Considerations

| EUR | 50% hedged | Diversification benefit |
| GBP | 50% hedged | Political volatility |
| CHF | Unhedged | Safe-haven characteristics |
| SEK | Unhedged | Small allocation |

### 5.2 Currency Impact Analysis

Historical EUR/USD volatility: ~8% annually
- Hedging cost: ~1.5%/year
- Recommend partial hedge for risk management
