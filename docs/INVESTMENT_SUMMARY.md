# Investment Summary for American Equity Investors

## Plain-Language Summary

This document provides a non-technical summary of the CAPM analysis findings and their implications for American equity investors considering European markets.

---

## What We Found

### The Big Picture

We tested whether the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) works in European stock markets. **The answer is no** - beta (market risk) alone does not explain stock returns. This is actually good news for investors because it means there are opportunities to earn better returns by being smart about which stocks to pick.

### Key Finding: Lower Risk Can Mean Higher Returns

**Surprising Result:** Stocks with lower market risk (lower beta) actually earned **higher returns** than stocks with higher market risk. This is the opposite of what CAPM predicts.

- **Low-risk stocks:** Earned about 1.20% per month on average
- **High-risk stocks:** Earned only about 0.54% per month on average

**What This Means:** You don't need to take on more risk to earn higher returns in European markets. In fact, lower-risk stocks performed better.

## What This Means for You (American Investor)

### Currency Risk: Not a Problem

**Good News:** The European stock market indexes we analyzed are already in US dollars. This means:

- ✅ No currency conversion needed
- ✅ No need to worry about exchange rates
- ✅ Easy to buy and sell (trade on US exchanges)
- ✅ Simple portfolio management

**How to Invest:** Use iShares ETFs that trade in USD:
- EWG (Germany), EWQ (France), EWI (Italy), EWP (Spain)
- EWD (Sweden), EWU (United Kingdom), EWL (Switzerland)

### Country Allocation: Diversify Across All Markets

**Recommendation:** Invest equally across all 7 European countries (about 14% each).

**Why:**
- Diversification reduces risk significantly (about 82% variance reduction)
- No single country dominates
- Spreads risk across different economies

### Investment Strategy: Hybrid Approach Works Best

**Recommended Portfolio:**

1. **Core Holdings (60-70%):**
   - Broad European ETF (like VGK - Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF)
   - OR equal-weight across country ETFs
   - This gives you basic market exposure

2. **Factor Tilts (20-30%):**
   - Low-volatility stocks (10-15%)
   - Value stocks (10-15%)
   - These exploit the fact that CAPM doesn't work

3. **Active Selection (10-20%):**
   - Pick individual stocks with:
     - Low market risk (beta < 0.8)
     - High quality (strong financials)
   - This takes advantage of market inefficiencies

## Expected Returns and Risks

### What to Expect

**Returns:**
- Average monthly return: About 1.0-1.5% (varies by strategy)
- Lower-risk stocks: About 1.20% per month
- Higher-risk stocks: About 0.54% per month

**Risk:**
- Portfolio volatility: About 1.9% per month

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Core Allocation (60-70%)

**Option A: Simple**
- Buy: VGK (Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF)
- This gives you exposure to all European markets
- Rebalance quarterly or annually

**Option B: Diversified**
- Buy equal amounts of: EWG, EWQ, EWI, EWP, EWD, EWU, EWL
- About 14% in each country
- Rebalance quarterly to keep equal weights

### Step 2: Add Factor Tilts (20-30%)

- **Low-Volatility:** Buy EFAV (iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Europe ETF) - 10-15%
- **Value:** Buy EFV (iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF) - 10-15%
- Rebalance twice a year

### Step 3: Active Selection (10-20%) - Optional

- Pick individual European stocks with:
  - Low market risk (beta < 0.8)
  - Strong financials (high return on equity, low debt)
- Rebalance quarterly

### Step 4: Monitor and Rebalance

- **Quarterly:** Check if allocations have drifted more than 5%
- **Annually:** Review whether factor strategies are still working
- **Ongoing:** Monitor European market conditions
